# OGC tests

This document provides information about how to install and configure the OGC tests

---

# Prerequisite SW

## Install Maven

Maven versions 3.2.2 and 3.2.5 have been tested and work Download from here

```ssh
curl https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.2.2/apache-maven-3.2.2-bin.tar.gz > apache-maven-3.2.2.tar.gz
```

Unzip it:

```ssh
tar xzvf apache-maven-3.2.2-bin.tar.gz
```

Add the bin directory of the created directory apache-maven-3.3.2 to the PATH environment variable

```ssh
vi ~/.bash_profile
M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.2.2
export M2_HOME
source ./bash_profile
```

Confirm with mvn -v in a new shell. The result should look similar to

```ssh
Apache Maven 3.2.2 (45f7c06d68e745d05611f7fd14efb6594181933e; 2014-06-17T15:51:42+02:00)
Maven home: /Users/irios/git/sensorWeb/testsServer/apache-maven-3.2.2
Java version: 1.8.0_91, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_91.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: es_ES, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.11.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: Java 8 at least is required in order to configure and run the tests successfully

# Configure TEAM engine

## Download and install TE

```ssh
git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine.git repo/teamengine
```

Build TE source:

```ssh
cd repo/teamengine
mvn install
```

This has to finish with a BUILD SUCCESS message. It would be necessary to unzip files generated into TE_BASE and te-install as follows in the next steps. These files will have the version of the teamengine tag used. In this case master would correspond with 4.10-SNAPSHOT. NOTE: The branches tested have been 4.2 and master.

## Configure TE_BASE

Create a dir TE_BASE Add to the Path

```ssh
TE_BASE=~/TE_BASE
```

In some cases it is necessary to be able to launch the tests, absolute path does not work but relative does.

Unzip the corresponding -base.zip file generated in repo/teamengine into this dir

```ssh
unzip /repo/teamengine/teamengine-console/target/teamengine-console-4.10-RC2-SNAPSHOT-base.zip .
```

## Configure te-install

At the same level than TE_BASE Create a dir te-install and unzip the corresponding -bin.zip file generated in repo/teamengine into this dir.

```ssh
unzip ~/repo/teamengine/teamengine-console/target/teamengine-console-4.10-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip -d .
```

## Download and install sta-10 tests

Clone the repo with the tests:

```ssh
git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-sta10.git
```

Install the tests:

```ssh
cd ets-sta10
mvn clean install
```

Once the mvn finishes with BUILD SUCCESS, go to target folder and unzip the files below into the corresponding folders

```ssh
cd target
unzip  ets-sta10-0.8-SNAPSHOT-ctl.zip ~/TE_BASE/scripts
unzip ets-sta10-0.8-SNAPSHOT-deps.zip ~/TE_BASE/resources/lib
```

# Preconditions to run the tests

In order to launch the tests this precondition should be met:

```ssh
http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/about/sta10/1.0/site/
```

To achieve that a POST request has to be made with that data.

# Run the tests

Once the server is running and the script to populate the db has finished, it is possible to launch the tests.

## Command to run the tests

```ssh
~/te-install/bin/unix/test.sh -source=~TE_BASE/scripts/sta10/1.0/ctl/sta10-suite.ctl
```

## Command to run the tests in headless mode

```ssh
~/te-install/bin/unix/test.sh -source=~TE_BASE/scripts/sta10/1.0/ctl/sta10-suite.ctl -form=~forms/sta10.xml
```

form sta10.xml has to be created. This would be an example of it: `ssh <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <values> <value key="uri">http://localhost:8080/v1.0</value> <value key="doc"></value> <value key="level">1</value> </values>`

## Result of the tests

This would be a summary of the execution of the test suite: `ssh Test suite: sta10-0.8-SNAPSHOT ======== Test groups ======== Conformance Level 1 Passed: 1 | Failed: 5 | Skipped: 0 Conformance Level 2 Passed: 0 | Failed: 0 | Skipped: 9 Conformance Level 3 Passed: 0 | Failed: 0 | Skipped: 8`

The logs can be found under TE_BASE folder.

```ssh
TE_BASE/users/{userName}/{number of the execution}/html/
```

# OGC tests in travis

Maven is already installed in travis, so it is not necessary to install it. Be aware of the jdk version installed in travis, version 8 or higher is required.

See the scripts for installing the necessary tools:

```ssh
https://github.com/isabelrios/sensorthings/blob/ogc-tests-travis/scripts/OGC_tests/install_tests.sh
```

And for launching the tests:

```ssh
https://github.com/isabelrios/sensorthings/blob/ogc-tests-travis/scripts/OGC_tests/launch_tests.sh
```

So that the test can pass, it is necessary also to set the required preconditions:

```ssh
https://github.com/mozilla-sensorweb/sensorthings/tree/master/scripts/preconditions.sh
```
